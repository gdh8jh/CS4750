2. Find the names of the sailors who have reserved a red boat and a blue boat. Do not repeat the names of the same sailors.

select DISTINCT S.sname
from sailors S, boats B, reserves R, boats B2, reserves R2
where S.sid = R.sid and r.bid = b.bid and s.sid = r2.sid and r2.bid = b2.bid
and (b.color = 'Red' AND b2.color = 'Blue')

3. Find the names of the sailors who have reserved all the boats.

select S.sname
from sailors S
where not EXISTS
(select B.bid

     from reserves R
     where R.bid = B.bid
     and R.sid = S.sid))
